How the Code Works

1. Inputs:
start: A list of start times for each activity.
finish: A list of finish times for each activity.
Each activity is represented by an interval [start[i], finish[i]).
Activities must already be sorted by their finish times. If they arenâ€™t sorted, you would sort them first.

2. Greedy Strategy
Always choose the activity that finishes earliest (among those that are compatible with the already selected activities).
Why? By choosing the earliest finishing activity, you maximize the remaining time for subsequent activities, leaving more room for others.

3. Steps in the Code
Initialization:

Start by always selecting the first activity (selected = [0]). This corresponds to the activity at index 0.
last keeps track of the index of the most recently selected activity (initially 0).

Iterate Over Activities:

For each activity i (starting from the second activity):
Check if the start time of activity i is greater than or equal to the finish time of the last selected activity.
This ensures i does not overlap with previously selected activities.
If the activity is compatible, select it:
Add its index to selected.
Update last to point to the current activity i.
Return the Selected Activities:

The list selected contains the indices of the activities in the order they were selected.
Example Walkthrough

Inputs:

start_times = [1, 3, 0, 5, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 12]
finish_times = [4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16]
Step-by-Step Execution:
Initialization:

selected = [0] (Select the first activity, which ends at 4.)
last = 0.
Iterate Over Remaining Activities:

Activity 1: start[1] = 3, finish[1] = 5
start[1] < finish[0] (Overlaps), so skip.
Activity 2: start[2] = 0, finish[2] = 6
start[2] < finish[0] (Overlaps), so skip.
Activity 3: start[3] = 5, finish[3] = 7
start[3] >= finish[0] (Compatible), so select.
Update selected = [0, 3], last = 3.
Activity 4: start[4] = 3, finish[4] = 9
start[4] < finish[3] (Overlaps), so skip.
Activity 5: start[5] = 5, finish[5] = 9
start[5] < finish[3] (Overlaps), so skip.
Activity 6: start[6] = 6, finish[6] = 10
start[6] < finish[3] (Overlaps), so skip.
Activity 7: start[7] = 7, finish[7] = 11
start[7] >= finish[3] (Compatible), so select.
Update selected = [0, 3, 7], last = 7.
Activity 8: start[8] = 8, finish[8] = 12
start[8] < finish[7] (Overlaps), so skip.
Activity 9: start[9] = 2, finish[9] = 14
start[9] < finish[7] (Overlaps), so skip.
Activity 10: start[10] = 12, finish[10] = 16
start[10] >= finish[7] (Compatible), so select.
Update selected = [0, 3, 7, 10], last = 10.
Result:

selected = [0, 3, 7, 10]
Selected activities:
Activity 0: [1, 4)
Activity 3: [5, 7)
Activity 7: [7, 11)
Activity 10: [12, 16)

Output:
Selected activities: [0, 3, 7, 10]
Time Complexity
Sorting: O(nlogn) (if input is not pre-sorted by finish times).
Selection:O(n), since each activity is checked once.
Overall:O(nlogn), dominated by sorting.
Key Points
This is a greedy algorithm that makes locally optimal choices.
It guarantees a globally optimal solution for the activity-selection problem because the greedy-choice property holds for this problem.
