Give an O.n lg n/-time algorithm to ûnd the longest monotonically increasing sub-
sequence of a sequence of n numbers. (Hint: The last element of a candidate subse-
quence of length i is at least as large as the last element of a candidate subsequence
of length i  1. Maintain candidate subsequences by linking them through the input
sequence.
